# GrepAnizer

## Description

"This Python script scrutinizes the results of an `Nmap` grep file scan across an IP range. It distills the port numbers and descriptions from the scan data, and then arranges this information in a lucid and systematic manner, sorted by open ports and IP addresses. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding during the initial scan of multiple hosts and the services they host."
